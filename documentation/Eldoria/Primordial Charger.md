## Primordial Charger – Brute of Elemental Wrath

"In the heat of their rage, the world remembers its first voice—the one that cracked the sky and lit the rivers with molten blood."

---

### Role and Archetype

Primal warrior and elemental juggernaut. Primordial Chargers are avatars of natural fury, embodying the ancient violence of Eldoria’s forming forces.

---

### Visual Identity

Massive and volcanic in appearance, their armor crackles with glowing fault-lines of Aether and raw elemental energy. Their weapon appears torn from the land itself, emanating primal force. Their sigil is a horned battle helm against a backdrop of cleaving axes and erupting stone.

---

### 💠 Connection to Aetheric Phenomena

Ashfounts & Elemental Nodes. Their rage channels the violent resonance of fire and pure elemental magic. Unlike other classes, their bond to these phenomena fuels their combat directly.

“Before there was order, there was us—screaming into the void with fists of flame.”

---

### 🦴 Aetheric Adaptation

Primordial Chargers share the passive Aether infusion seen in Aetherblades and Aethershields—skin, bones, and muscles hardened by constant exposure. But unlike them, the Charger houses a vast, volatile reserve of Aether deep within, a molten core that only reveals itself in the height of fury. This makes them walking pressure vessels of elemental wrath.

“Their body is stone, their flame is caged, their rage is a prayer waiting to be answered.”

### ⚔️ Philosophy and Orders

Followers of the Sundering Creed believe destruction is sacred cleansing. Some Chargers isolate themselves in wild zones to commune with phenomena directly—returning only when fury becomes prophecy.
