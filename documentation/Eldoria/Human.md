## 🧍 Humans – Bearers of Boundless Potential

### Lore Summary

Humans in Eldoria are mortal, short-lived, and biologically unremarkable—yet they are profoundly adaptable, with a natural affinity for both Vitalis and Entropis. Though fragile compared to other races, their resilience and creativity have allowed them to thrive in every corner of the world. Their greatest strength lies in their capacity to evolve, shape destiny, and walk the line of balance like few others can.
