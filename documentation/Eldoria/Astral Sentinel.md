## Astral Sentinel – Bulwark of the Breach

"I do not strike first. I endure. I remain."

---

### Role and Archetype

Defender and magical anchor. Astral Sentinels specialize in shielding allies and stabilizing chaotic energy through unmatched fortitude and resonance.

---

### Visual Identity

Towering and stoic, clad in smooth radiant armor without excess. Their hexagonal shield pulses with harmonic energy, while their sword glows with protective resolve. Their emblem is a nested diamond within a shield, framed by concentric ripples—symbol of enduring defense.

---

### 💠 Connection to Aetheric Phenomena

None directly. Astral Sentinels are unique among warriors—they draw directly from the **Luminous Aether**, not through finesse or redirection, but by sheer capacity.  
They absorb vast quantities of raw Aether to ground instability, serving as anchors in magical chaos.

“Others shape Aether—I hold it steady when it tries to break free.”

---

### 🦴 Aetheric Adaptation

Over time, their bones and skin fuse with radiant Aether, forming natural armor that resists entropy and magic. Some believe their unshakable presence is touched by  **The Astral Light** itself—a guiding echo that chooses vessels of endurance.

“I am not built to bend—I am what keeps others from breaking.”
