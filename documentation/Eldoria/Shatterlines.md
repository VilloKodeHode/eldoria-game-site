### Shatterlines – Scars of the Shattering

Born in the violent moment the Aether Core was sundered, Shatterlines are raw scars etched into the very bones of Eldoria. These jagged rifts continue to bleed unstable Aether into the world, crackling with disruption. The elemental force known as **Shatter**—a volatile blend of lightning, disruption, and raw resonance—originates exclusively from these fractures.

**Appearance:** Jagged glowing fissures, levitating stone shards, fractured gravity fields, and areas of unstable magnetism. Thunder hums at the edge of perception.  
**Nature:** Dangerous and unpredictable. Shatterlines pulse in cycles—expanding or collapsing over time. New fractures occasionally splinter from their edges.  
**Magical Function:** Source of the Shatter element. Their energy can fracture enchantments, overload constructs, and obliterate magical shields.  
**Cultural Role:** Treated as holy and hazardous. Guarded by magical orders and feared by common folk. Some Riftshrouds and Aetheric Sages seek them as fonts of revelation.

### Folklore 
The largest known Shatterline, the Howling Arc, hums across the broken skies of Thar’Zaul. It is said to sing when something ancient stirs within.
