## Forgewright – Engineer of the Impossible

"If the world is broken, I will reforge it—gear by gear, spark by spark."

---

### Role and Archetype

Arcane engineer and entropy technologist. Forgewrights blend structure and chaos, crafting machines and magical devices powered by phenomena and Aether alike.

---

### Visual Identity

Plated in exoskeletal gear and glowing with power conduits, the Forgewright’s tools are their weapons. Their limbs pulse with arcane seals and circuitry. Their sigil is a rune-carved gear nested inside a web of radiant loops—logic forged from light.

---

### 💠 Connection to Aetheric Phenomena

All [[Aetheric Phenomena]]. Using their mechanized components, Forgewrights synchronize with Ashfounts, Shatterlines, Voidrifts, and Elemental Nodes. Their tools stabilize, amplify, or repurpose wild magic.

“Why fear the storm, when you can socket it into a blade?”

---

### 🦴 Aetheric Adaptation

Forgewrights passively adapt to Aether, but they are the least naturally attuned among the classes. To compensate, they boost their adaptation by drawing Aether through their mechanical augmentations, which refine raw Aether into a more potent, usable form. This refined energy is then distributed to fortify their internal systems and fuel their arcane machinery.

*“My limbs remember the forge. My heart runs on storms.”*

### ⚔️ Philosophy and Orders

The Tempered Logic guides most Forgewrights—its dogma frames Aether as data, and phenomena as solvable systems. They believe entropy must be mapped, not feared.

### ✨ Symbolism and Role in Eldoria

Seen as innovators and heretics, Forgewrights shape the future from the chaos of the present. They are the only class trusted to operate deep within corrupted Aetherlabs.
