## 🪓 Stonekin – Wardens of the Deep Earth

### Lore Summary

The Stonekin are enduring, earth-forged beings shaped by millennia of exposure to Aether-infused stone. Short, broad, and sturdy, they are born of Vitalis and Entropis working in mineral harmony. Masters of craft and keepers of subterranean knowledge, they act as guardians of ancient truths buried beneath Eldoria’s surface.

#### 🌌 Homeland: Karadum, the Vaulted Forge

An underground realm beneath the Ironshard Peaks, Karadum is a labyrinth of glowing forge-chambers, crystal-lit halls, and geothermal sanctuaries. It is here that the Great Forgehall hums with songs of molten Aether and living stone.

#### 📖 Myth: The First Hammerfall

The Stonekin believe they were born when the Astral Light’s first shard struck the heart of the world, forging Tham’Rukh, the Prime Anvil. The echo of that blow still rings in the soul of every Stonekin, guiding their path of creation and endurance.

#### 🏛️ Faction: The Graven Order

An ascetic order of rune-carvers and memory-keepers who believe the world’s salvation lies in preserving true form—the original shapes of Aether, memory, and meaning. They resist all corruption, even “benevolent” growth, and oppose excessive Vitalis influence.

#### 🗿 Unique Artifact: The Heartforge Keystone

Said to be a fragment of Tham’Rukh itself, this massive rune-stone allows a master mason to reshape entire landscapes by harmonizing Vitalis and Entropis through song, hammer, and vision. It was last seen carried into the Fracturewilds during Thraegor’s final battle.
