### **The Formation of Eldoria**

- **[[The Astral Light]]** – The original, transcendent will that shaped the Luminous Aether and gave intention to existence.
    
- **[[The Aether Core]]** – Forged by the Astral Light to refine raw Aether into usable forces: Vitalis and Entropis.
    
- **[[The Shattering]]** – The deliberate fracturing of the Aether Core, giving birth to the world of Eldoria and the divine children of balance, creation, and transformation.
    
- **Eldoria's Emergence** – The land formed from the fallout of the Shattering, infused with Aether, seeded with shards of Vitalis and Entropis. Several [[Aetheric Phenomena]] was a result of the chaotic creation of Eldoria
    
- **[[Rise of Mortal Races]]** - The mortal races rose from the residual aether that filled eldoria.
