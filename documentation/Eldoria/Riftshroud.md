## Riftshroud – Shadowdancer of Fractured Realms

"When the light blinds, I walk where it cannot reach."

---

### Role and Archetype

Stealth-based rogue and entropy channeler. Riftshrouds manipulate space, shadow, and unraveling energy to strike from unseen realms.

---

### Visual Identity

The Riftshroud wears layered armor in shades of blackened steel and obsidian cloth, trimmed in faint golden entropy lines. Their presence is angular and elusive, eyes glowing faintly beneath a darkened hood. Their weapons—curved, flickering with instability—seem to shift with their wielder. Their emblem is a downward-pointed dagger flanked by mirrored flames, symbolizing hidden force and duality.

### 💠 Connection to Aetheric Phenomena

Voidrifts. Riftshrouds are born from and thrive within proximity to Voidrifts. Their powers include phasing, disappearance, and unraveling of space. They perceive the soft tears in reality and move through them.

“I do not walk the world—I slip between its failures.”

---

### 🦴 Aetheric Adaptation

Their nervous system and visual cortex become laced with Aetheric filaments, enhancing reflexes and sensory perception. They move faster, strike sooner, and see deeper into entropy than most beings ever will.

“Even stillness echoes before I act.”

### ⚔️ Philosophy and Orders

Trained in secretive societies such as the Whispercloaks, Riftshrouds follow personal codes that vary by region. Some act as sacred assassins, others as vigilante philosophers of decay.
