### **The Shattering – Birth of the World**

In a single divine moment, the Astral Light shattered the Aether Core. Not in rage, but in radiant understanding. Balance was undone—and from its undoing, Eldoria was born.

- From shards: continents, oceans, and skies took form
    
- From rupture: gods emerged, born of released resonance
    
- From tension: magic surged, wild and unpredictable
    

Across the forming world, phenomena bloomed:

- Shatterlines – Veins of unstable wild Aether
    
- Voidrifts – Entropis-born tears in the Veil
    
- Elemental Nodes – Vitalis-charged nexuses of power
    

Eldoria was not shaped by divine hand—it is the consequence of a divine risk.
