### **The Shattering of the Aether Core**

Perfection, however, could not remain still.

To bring forth true creation—worlds teeming with life, complexity, and spirit—the [[The Astral Light]] made the ultimate sacrifice. It **shattered the [[The Aether Core]]**, sending fragments across the void. From the cascade of its destruction arose **Eldoria**, a world born of balance and contradiction.

This act also sundered the Astral Light itself into two guiding forces:

- **Harmony** – the echo of balance and unity.
    
- **Chaos** – the pulse of change and challenge.
    

#### **From the Shards**

Each shard of the Aether Core became a wellspring of power:

- **Vitalis Shards** birthed forests, rivers, and vibrant plains.
    
- **Entropis Shards** formed mountains, caverns, and arid lands.
    
- **Aether Lines** stretched between shards, becoming magical leylines that pulse through Eldoria.
    

But these gifts came with cost. **Shatterlines**, **Void Rifts**, and **Elemental Nodes** marked the scars left by the Core’s destruction, releasing wild Aether and reshaping the land.
