In a single divine moment, the Astral Light shattered [[The Aether Core]]. Not in rage, but in radiant understanding. Balance was undone—and from its undoing, Eldoria was born.

 The planet Eldoria formed from the fallout of the Shattering, infused with Aether, seeded with [[The Shards of Vitalis and Entropis]]. Several Aetheric Phenomena was a result of the chaotic breaking of the core
   
The mortal races rose from the residual aether that filled eldoria.

*Eldoria was not shaped by divine hand—it is the consequence of a divine risk.*
