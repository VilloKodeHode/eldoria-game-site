### Voidrifts – Mouths of Entropic Memory

Voidrifts are rips in the fabric of space and time, formed where Entropis saturated the world during the Shattering. They appear as whirling, mist-veiled portals into dimensions where decay, memory, and entropy reign. Voidrifts are the birthplace of **Rime**—an elemental force of existential cold, time stasis, and soul fragmentation.

**Appearance:** Rotating portals wreathed in violet mist, glistening frost, and shards of unreal geometry. Cold and silence dominate their vicinity.  
**Nature:** Anchored, yet reactive. They distort time and memory. Some manifest whispers or replay fragments of ancient lives.  
**Magical Function:** Source of the Rime element. Their power is invoked in spells of silence, slowing, and memory alteration.  
**Cultural Role:** Feared and studied. Umbrans and twilight mystics perform sacred rituals nearby. Some mystics enter Voidrifts willingly to find answers—or vanish seeking them.

### Folklore
In Vel'Khazir, the Oracle Ravine contains a sealed Voidrift where its been observes seers touch lost timelines in trance.
