## ‚öôÔ∏è Skyforged ‚Äì The Aether-Bound Artifice

### Lore Summary

The Skyforged are ancient, sentient automatons brought to life by infusions of the Luminous Aether. Born from the harmonious union of Vitalis and Entropis, they are living relics of a bygone era when Aether was shaped with precision and reverence. Though forged from metal and crystal, they possess minds and souls as complex as any mortal. Their existence is a constant pursuit of inner balance to sustain their Aether Core, the heart of their consciousness.
