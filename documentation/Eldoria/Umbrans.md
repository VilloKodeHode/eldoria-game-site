## 🌑 Umbrans – Children of the Veil

### Lore Summary

The Umbrans are enigmatic beings born in the twilight regions of Eldoria, shaped by the flowing currents of Entropis and shadow. Existing between the material and the ethereal, they thrive in darkness, secrecy, and transformation. Though many fear them, the Umbrans are not evil by nature—they are keepers of secrets, stewards of transition, and dwellers in the forgotten spaces of the world.

#### 🏙️ Homeland: Noctherion, the Twilight Labyrinth

A veiled metropolis that exists partially in the Shadowrealm, where buildings shift like dreams and memory itself becomes malleable. Only Umbrans can navigate it fully without becoming lost in the folds of half-reality.

#### 📜 Myth: The First Veil

Legend tells of Syrraka the First Veilwalker, an Umbran ancestor who wove the first bridge between shadow and light. Her cloak became the boundary between worlds, and her final whisper is said to echo forever through Shatterlines.

#### 🧥 Unique Artifact: The Cloak of Hollow Echoes

A relic said to be woven from lost shadows, it allows the wearer to fade from memory and sight. Once donned, even the world forgets they ever existed—unless anchored by the name of someone who still remembers them.
