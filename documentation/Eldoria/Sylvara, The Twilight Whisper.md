### Sylvara, The Twilight Whisper

Aspect: Duality – Light and Shadow  
Depiction: A graceful being half-shrouded in shadow, half-luminous. Her form changes in the observer’s eyes, embodying what lies between opposites.  
Myth: Manifested at the boundary of the First Fracture, where light and shadow embraced rather than collided.  
Symbols: A crescent moon split between opposing sides  
Worship: Honored at dawn, dusk, and in liminal spaces between decisions, fates, and states of being  
Followers: Veilweavers, Umbrans, shapeshifters, dreamwalkers, and twilight mystics
Race: Ancestral [[Umbran]]

"Truth lies not in light, nor in shadow—but in the place they meet."

### Folklore
Her voice is heard in dreams, and she’s often invoked during divinations or shadow rites.
