### **Mortal Races**

- **[[Eldrin]]** – Born from the Balanced Flow near the Aetherreach; deeply attuned to harmony and study.
    
- **[[Umbran]]** – Formed in the shadowed echoes of Entropis; seekers of duality, memory, and veiled power.
    
- **[[Verdwalker]]** – Emerged from Vitalis-saturated wilds; nature-bound kin to the living forests.
    
- **[[Stonekin]]** – Awakened from deep Aether-infused stone; resilient children of creation and decay.
    
- **[[Skyforged]]** – Birthed through artificial Aetheric design; clockwork mortals empowered by intention.
    
- **[[Eidralis]]** – Formed from echoes of the Colossi and deep Entropic memory; preservers of what was.
    
- **[[Human]]** – Born of balance, change, and chaos; vessels of potential shaped by culture.
