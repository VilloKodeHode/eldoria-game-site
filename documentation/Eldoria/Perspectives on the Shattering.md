### **Perspectives on the Shattering**

The truth of [[The Shattering]] is fixedâ€”but its meaning is not. Across Eldoria, traditions see it differently:

- [[Eldrins]]: A sacred sacrifice that allowed free will
    
- [[Umbrans]]: A tragic breaking that brought pain and potential
    
- [[Skyforged]]: A fundamental law in the equation of existence
    
- [[Verdwalkers]]: A natural act in a greater cycle
    
- [[Eidralis]]: A resonance still echoing in all things
    
- [[Humans]]: A inevitable event to create life
    


All agree: from [[The Shattering]] came choice. And from choice, meaning.
