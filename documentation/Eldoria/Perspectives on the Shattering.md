### **Perspectives on the Shattering**

The truth of [[The Shattering]] is fixedâ€”but its meaning is not. Across Eldoria, traditions see it differently:

- Eldrin: A sacred sacrifice that allowed free will
    
- Umbran: A tragic breaking that brought pain and potential
    
- Skyforged: A fundamental law in the equation of existence
    
- Verdwalker: A natural act in a greater cycle
    
- Eidralis: A resonance still echoing in all things
    
- Human: A inevitable event to create life
    
- Stonekin: A logical solution by the creators will
    

All agree: from [[The Shattering]] came choice. And from choice, meaning.
