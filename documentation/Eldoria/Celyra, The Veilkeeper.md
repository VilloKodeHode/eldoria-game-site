### Celyra, The Veilkeeper

Aspect: Balance – Harmony and Preservation  
Depiction: A cloaked figure with features woven from both light and shadow, moving with the grace of still water. Her eyes shimmer like mirrored threads.  
Myth: She wove the first Veil, allowing Vitalis and Entropis to interact without consuming one another.  
Symbols: A suspended veil woven from opposing threads held in both hands  
Worship: Revered during rites of meditation, attunement, balance, and restoration of magical equilibrium  
Followers: Aetherforged, seers, monks, keepers of peace, and mediators
Race: Ancestral [[Eldrin]]

"She does not bind the forces—she teaches them to dance."

### Folklore
Celyra’s presence is strongest near Elemental Nodes. Some say she walks unseen along the Veil where equilibrium is threatened.
