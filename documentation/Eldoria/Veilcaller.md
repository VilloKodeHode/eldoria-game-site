### üí† Connection to Aetheric Phenomena

**The Veil.** While many call on power from within, Veilcallers extend outward, binding threads from the Veil to form pacts with entities beyond. Their summons also tap into the harmonic flow of Aether.

### ü¶¥ Aetheric Adaptation

Their soul absorbs and channels Aether directly, growing in resonance until it nears that of a lesser divine. Their essence becomes a beacon‚Äîstrong enough to call forth echoes from across dimensions.

> _‚ÄúMy soul is not bound to flesh. It remembers more than this life.‚Äù_
