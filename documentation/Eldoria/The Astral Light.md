### **The Astral Light – The First Will, the World-Shaper**

The Astral Light did not rise from the Aether—it descended upon it. A radiant consciousness, transcendent and absolute, it is the first will to stir the stillness. Where the Aether shimmered aimlessly, the Astral Light brought order, shape, and design.

- Role: Divine architect, not of the Aether, but of what the Aether could become.
    
- Presence: Unreachable, unknowable, but felt in balance, resonance, and clarity.
    
- Worship: Honored across Eldoria not as a god, but as the concept of perfect purpose.
    

It is the guiding presence that shaped magic, soul, and symmetry—never interfering, but always watching.
