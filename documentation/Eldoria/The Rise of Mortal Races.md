**‚ÄúFrom the breath of the Aether and the echoes of balance, the mortal races stepped into the world‚Äîeach a reflection of harmony, imbalance, and the infinite potential of becoming.‚Äù**

### üåç Origin

The [[Mortal Races]] of Eldoria did not arise all at once, nor by the same means. Some were **shaped by elemental will**, others **emerged from the primal forces** unleashed during the Shattering. While each race walks a different path, all are bound by a shared trait: **mortality infused with Aetheric potential**. They are not passive dwellers of Eldoria but active shapers‚Äîwielding, resisting, or embodying the forces of Vitalis and Entropis.

### ‚ú® Role in the World

Mortals exist **between permanence and change**, between divinity and beast. Unlike the divine children of the Astral Light, mortals must **learn, suffer, adapt, and grow**. And in that struggle lies the secret of their strength. They do not channel perfection‚Äîthey evolve toward it.

Many mortal individuals are capable of becoming **Aetherforged**, ascending through the balanced mastery of Vitalis and Entropis into paragons of their kind.
