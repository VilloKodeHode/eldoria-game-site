### **The Divine Children of the Astral Light**

When the [[The Astral Light]] shattered the Aether Core to release Vitalis and Entropis into motion, its act of cosmic rupture echoed across the metaphysical fabric of the world. From those echoes, consciousness crystallized. Forces once abstract became self-aware. Thus, the divine pantheon of Eldoria was born—not forged nor chosen, but manifested.

These are not gods in the mortal sense, but cosmic archetypes given form. They are the embodiment of principles shaped by the resonance of the Shattering. Each represents a facet of reality as it struggles toward meaning.

The greater deites:

**[[Celyra, The Veilkeeper]]**

**[[Tharos, The Withering Shadow]]**

**[[Orathis, The Eternal Root]]**


The lesser deites:

**[[Liora, The Radiant Bloom]]**

**[[Korvex, The Shattered Flame]]**

**[[Sylvara, The Twilight Whisper]]**


These deities are not fixed in doctrine or dogma. They are shaped by the regions that revere them and the mortals who reflect their nature. They walk through dream, vision, and rite—not to be worshipped from afar, but to be lived through.

*In Eldoria, to know the divine is not to follow—but to resonate.*
