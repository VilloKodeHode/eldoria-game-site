### Elemental Nodes – Wells of Pure Magic

Elemental Nodes are ancient pillars of luminous Aether that pierce the sky, surrounded by rings of levitating crystal and harmonic resonance. Unlike Shatterlines, these Nodes are stable and neutral—neither Vitalis nor Entropis dominates them. They are the **purest source of elemental forces** like earth, water, and air.

**Appearance:** Beams of light rising vertically, surrounded by floating crystalline rings and pulsing ley-lines that radiate outward into the land.  
**Nature:** Harmonious and stable. They maintain the elemental structure of surrounding regions.  
**Magical Function:** Used in advanced spellcraft, elemental shaping, and ritual anchoring. Often tapped for protective wards and reality-binding magics.  
**Cultural Role:** Sacred to geomancers, windcallers, and arcane architects. Many magical cities are built atop or around them.

### Folklore
Some Nodes are so ancient they sing in harmonic patterns that influence dreams. The Crystal Choir of Aevaris Reach is said to have been built to amplify these songs.
