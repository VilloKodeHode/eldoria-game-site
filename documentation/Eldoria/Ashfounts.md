### Ashfounts – Hearts of Sacred Flame

Ashfounts are violent geysers of ancient magic, created where Vitalis and Entropis clashed most intensely. They are the origin of **Ember**—an elemental force of sacred fire, renewal through destruction, and soul-forged flame. Though mostly stable, Ashfounts flare in cycles, unleashing raw magical conflagration.

**Appearance:** Obsidian-lined craters brimming with living fire, glowing rivers of emberlight, and flame-kissed stone glyphs.  
**Nature:** Stable but cyclical. Ashfounts enter periods of dormancy before erupting again. Their heat is more soul-burning than skin-burning.  
**Magical Function:** The heart of Ember magic. Used in rituals of rebirth, firecraft, and sacred forging. Their cycles are tracked in magical calendars.  
**Cultural Role:** Worshipped by warpriests, fire mages, and smith-cults. Some Aetherforged warriors undergo trial-forging at these sites.

### Folklore
The Molten Stair of Kar’Marok rises from an ancient Ashfount whose flames whisper forgotten names to those who listen.
